                "According to the report, the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria conducted a two-day intense and wide ranging debate on the state of the Nigerian economy. It observed that the negative GDP growth of 0.36% and 2.6% in the first and second quarters of 2016 technically plunged the national economy into recession. This contraction was largely due to the fall in oil revenues and further exacerbated by the vandalism of the nation’s oil assets in the Niger Delta region as well as the country’s plummeting foreign exchange reserve from more than $60 billion in 2007 to $24 billion currently.\n" +

                "4)\tThe need to ascertain the Degree of Local Content in Nigerian Oil and Gas industry, sponsored by Sen. Gershom Bassey (Cross River South). He stated that the Senate is aware that the National Committee on Local Content Development (NCLCD) discovered that the local participation in the upstream sector of the oil and gas industry in Nigeria was less than 5% meaning that 95% of the yearly expenditure of about $8 billion left the country. The Motion also sailed through with two resolutions below:\n" +

He advised that the Presidency must  consult the Governors before dipping its hands in the country’s commonwealth.  \n" +
                "The Law-maker called on Nigerians to protect the value of the naira for the nation’s economy to be buoyant.
